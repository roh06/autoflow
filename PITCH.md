# GarageJira: The Modern Operating System for Auto Garages

## The Problem
Running a garage is hard. You deal with:
*   **Constant Phone Calls**: "is my car ready?", "what's the update?"
*   **Paper Chaos**: Job cards get lost, stained, or misread.
*   **Inventory Leaks**: Parts disappear, or you realize too late you're out of stock.
*   **Trust Issues**: Customers don't see the hard work you put in; they only see the bill.

## The Solution: GarageJira
GarageJira is a **SaaS (Software as a Service) platform** designed to bring the transparency of Domino's Pizza Tracker to the complexity of Auto Repair. It turns your garage into a high-end, digital workshop.

### 1. For the Garage Owner (You)
*   **Digital Job Cards**: No more paper. Create tickets on a tablet/laptop. Track every stage: *Check-in -> Washing -> Polishing -> Ready*.
*   **Inventory Control**: Know exactly what you have in stock. Get alerts when you're running low on oil, filters, or pads.
*   **One-Click History**: A customer returns after 6 months? Instantly see what you did last time.

### 2. For Your Customer
*   **"Domino's" Style Tracker**: Customers get a link to their phone. They see real-time updates:
    > "Your car is currently: **Polishing**"
    > "Technician added a note: **Found scratch on bumper**"
*   **Trust & Premium Feel**: They see a professional, digital interface. It justifies premium pricing because they see a premium process.

## Why It Wins
1.  **Transparency = Trust**: When customers can track their repair, they stop calling you every hour. You save time; they feel informed.
2.  **Professional Image**: The "Esther Minimalist" design looks like a high-end dealership tool (BMW/Mercedes style), not a clunky old mechanic software.
3.  **Efficiency**: Your staff knows exactly what to work on next using the digital "Kanban Board" (Todo List).

## The Business Model
*   **Subscription**: Garages pay a monthly fee (e.g., $49/mo) to use the software.
*   **Multi-Tenant**: This isn't just a website for *one* garage. It's a platform where *any* garage can sign up, create their own account, and start managing their business instantly.
